<h1 id="Introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor-link" href="#Introduction"> </a></h1><p>The Mu2e Extinction Monitor (ExtMon) will provide a measurement of beam
extinction between proton pulses of for the duration of the Mu2e
experiment. Continuous measurement of extinction requires online
monitoring and software-based control of the ExtMon system during
operation. Here we present the proposed method for the ExtMon
slow-control software design and operation.</p>
